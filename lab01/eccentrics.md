# Exercise 1: Eccentrics of Rust

Look at the code contained in `eccentric.rs`. **Notice** the four different examples of basic Rust control flow. (What are they?)

First compile and run the program to see what it does. Play around with the constant values of the four variables: V0 through V3. See how changing each of them changes the program output.

## Action Item

Modifying only these four values, make the program produce the following output.

```text
Rust eccentrics:
====================
Happy Happy Happy
Yoshua
Go SOLANA!
```

There are actually several different combinations of variables that can give this output. Hereâ€™s the challenge for you in this exercise: **consider what the minimum number of distinct values that V0 through V3 can have such that they still give this exact output. For example, the theoretical maximum is four, when they are all distinct from each other.**
